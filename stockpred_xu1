## Optimization of machine learning techniques for stock price prediction

**Project description:** Optimization of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting stock prices for a selected company. My assumption is that the fluctuation patterns of stock prices vary between companies. Many existing machine learning/deep learning approaches can be applied to a time series data set of stock prices from a specific company with most probably different prediction accuracy and precision. Even the same approach is used if the feature selections or methods of feature engineering are different, and the results would also vary. This project will use a series of machine/deep learning approaches to analyze historic datasets of some selected stocks and choose a best combination of an algorithm, feature selection method, and similarity/distance measure for a specific company's stock.
### 1. The python script for the first plot

```javascript
# plot the data for volume for the AMZN stocks traded for the day
plt.plot(input_data[:,0])
plt.title("Volume of stocks sold")
plt.xlabel("Time (most current-> oldest)")
plt.ylabel("Volume of stocks traded")
plt.show()
}
```

### 2. he first plot on volume for the AMZN stocks traded for the day

### 3. The python script for the second plot

```javascript
# plot the data for volume for the AMZN stocks traded for the day
plt.plot(input_data[:,0])
plt.title("Volume of stocks sold")
plt.xlabel("Time (most current-> oldest)")
plt.ylabel("Volume of stocks traded")
plt.show()
}
```
